AutoVerify: A Decentralized AI-Powered Fact-Checking & Reputation System
1. Problem Statement
Misinformation, deepfakes, and AI-generated false narratives are growing concerns in the digital space. Social media platforms struggle to verify claims, and centralized fact-checking solutions often lack transparency.

2. Solution
AutoVerify is a decentralized fact-checking system powered by AI and stored on the Autonomys Network. It leverages permanent storage (DSN), fast data availability, and Auto ID to verify news, social media posts, and digital content in real-time.

3. How It Works
Claim Submission

Users submit news articles, social media posts, images, or videos for fact-checking.
AI agents scan the submitted content for potential misinformation.
AI Fact-Checking & On-Chain Verification

AI cross-references claims with trusted sources stored permanently on the Autonomys DSN.
It generates a truth score (0-100) based on credibility and historical accuracy.
Verified sources (news outlets, researchers) contribute data to improve accuracy.
Community & Expert Validation

Users with Auto ID verification can contribute by challenging or supporting a claim.
Smart contracts record expert votes, ensuring transparency.
Decentralized Reputation Tracking

A reputation system ranks sources and users based on accuracy history.
If a source repeatedly spreads false information, its credibility score decreases.
Integration with dApps & Social Media

Websites and dApps can integrate AutoVerify API to display real-time fact-checking scores.
Users see a verified "truth score" when browsing content.
4. Why AutoVerify is Ideal for Autonomys
✅ Uses DSN for permanent fact-check storage
✅ AI agents automate verification & improve accuracy
✅ Auto ID prevents bot manipulation & ensures transparency
✅ Fully decentralized, censorship-resistant, and community-driven
